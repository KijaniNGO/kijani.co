Marmanet Exemplifies Why Sustainability Is Crucial

Our Project takes place in East Africa, Kenya, specifically the North Marmanet region. Marmanet was a beautiful primary forest of _ square kilometers. Then, in the 80s, new people moved to the region and the timber industry boomed for a decade. But in the process 90% of the forest was destroyed and with the depletion of the ecosystem the economy broke down completely. Today it is a very poor area and youth unemployment is at _%. 

But the importance of this forest expands well beyond it's economic importance and function as a carbon sink. Together with the other East African highland forests it is an irreplaceable part of the African ecosystem. 

Without forests rain can't seep into the ground and that means that rivers and lakes are cut off from their water supply. Moreover the micro climate and therefore the rainfall pattern heavily depends on forests. That is why the East African highland forests are also called water towers. 

Amongst other water bodies lake Victoria and the Nile depend on those forests. Without these forests the survival of the African ecosystem with it's unique wildlive of X million different species is endangered. Moreover the water supply for X billion humans depends on this ecosystem. 

Between 1980 and 2000 the forest cover in Kenya has been reduced by 75%. In the last years there has been a big political effort to protect the remaining forests, but to ensure the health of this ecosystem X million hectares have to be reforested in Kenya. 

We have realized, that it is not enough to merely plant trees in order to restore these ecosystems. The mindset of people towards forests needs to change. We will show that a sustainably managed forest can provide a good and lasting livelihood to local people. Because a healthy forest is worth way more in the long run than the one time profit from selling all timber at once and leaving the ecosystem destroyed.
