			<h1>Marmanet acts as a microcosm to <br>understand the importance of sustainability.</h1>
			<p>Nested in the central highlands of Kenya, lies the Marmanet forest.</p>
			<p>50 years ago, the forest covered 40,000 hectares. Fast forward half a century, and over 90% of the forest has disappeared, and the local economy has collapsed. High unemployment and poverty is complemented by a loss of biodiversity and seasonal drought.</p>
			<p>This is where our project is based. We understand that humans are part and parcel of a forest ecosystem. Therefore our goal is not only to plant trees but to foster the sustainable development of this and other rural areas.</p>

			<h2>The Importance of the East African Highland Forests</h2>
			<article>
				<p>Apart from their function as carbon sinks these forests are home to a unique flora and fauna and in their function as water towers they are crucial to the African ecosystem as a whole.</p>
				<p>Forests enable rain water to seep into the ground. Without them, rivers and lakes are cut off from their water supply. The micro-climate is destabilized and rainfall patterns are affected. The highland forests are needed as water catchment areas for major lakes such as Lake Victoria - source of the Nile.</p>
				<p>Tens of thousands of rural farmers and pastoralists depend on this water. Furthermore it is a key necessity for three of the largest industries in Kenya: tourism, tea and hydroelectricity. Therefore in order to prevent water-related conflicts we need to reforest these woodlands now. </p>

			<h1>Become a part of developing sustainable forests in Kenya.</h1>
			<p>We need your help now to move on. We want to start planting trees on the 100 ha in October of 2014. To prepare these young trees in time we need to set up a tree nursery now. The community and the local forest officer are ready to help us and our team cannot wait to see the first fruits of all our preparation on location in Marmanet. Establishing the tree nursery and keeping it going for the first three months requires €2250.</p>
			<p>The money will allow us to purchase seeds, employ people from the local community in the nursery and to set up the tree nursery itself. We also need money for transportation and accommodation in Marmanet area, to enable our Kenyan team members to continue their voluntary work and conduct a first baseline survey.</p>
			<p>Soon we plan to be able to offer each supporter of Kijani their personal Kenyan tree sapling, with shipping throughout Europe. At this point however we cannot offer you a such a personal token of your contribution just yet. Since the trees we selected are indigenous to Kenya we are still testing how well they grow in European living rooms.</p>
